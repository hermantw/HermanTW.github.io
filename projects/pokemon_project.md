For a final project in a computer science class, I developed many individual pieces that eventually came together as a playable game.  Interfaces were developed for the many possible Pokemon types (e.g. grass, electric, etc.) in order to allow strengths and weaknesses to play a part in combat.  Several dozen separate pokemon were developed, with unique names, types, and stats, along with unique growth rates once instantiated.  A battle system was then developed to allow two players to compete.  They would each choose a pokemon, name them, and then watch the action happen...in text form.  In addition, a method for catching pokemon, storing them, and developing a pokedex (i.e. list of information about all caught pokemon, even those no longer owned).  Eventually I developed a GUI, such that with a text input box and four buttons all of these actions could be undertaken by the player(s).

It took months and many small (and big) steps, but eventually the project was a success!  Although I've been interested in games, algorithms, and programming for a long time, it was intimidating to undertake such a project.  In the end, it was a success and I then knew for sure I was capable of developing complex programs and games.  It was a relatively simple game, but it was my first and I know that all further efforts would just improve as did my skills and experience.

Unfortunately, somehow gitHub no longer has my final program, but it does still have some of the early coding: https://github.com/hermantw/a3-pokemonobjectheirarchy-f18-hermantw
