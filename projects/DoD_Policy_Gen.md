As an IT intern over the summer of 2019, I was faced with a seemingly insurmountable challenge: using several thick books of legalese to develop practical policies and procedures to be used by my company to meet the cybersecurity requirements of doing business with the United States Department of Defense.  At first, I had no idea how to start and felt in over my head as I'd assumed IT work would involve replacing computer parts and updating software.  However, I was determined to find a way to succeed.

I remembered something I'd read about when I was developing my interests in creative writing called the "Snowflake Method."  This technique involves starting from a small number of significant concepts, and then branching out each in further detail.  Each of these branches is fleshed out further, and after so many iterations (this is sounding like recursion a bit) a full product is complete.  Of course, it can still use some editing, but the bulk of the work is over with.  Using this strategy, I isolated each specific requirement, extracted relevant policy points and procedural requirements, and went from there.  Over time, something looking like a legitimate businesslike form began to take shape.  Despite no past interest, skill, or motivation in developing policies IAW dense government requirements, I had successfully found a way to create a detailed professional document.  This effort would ensure our company would not only be able to continue to conduct business with the government, but also to detail methods to avoid malicious cybersecurity attacks on our proprietary data and protect our business and jobs safe.  In the future when I feel a task is insurmountable, I will likely recall this experience and realize nearly anything can be accomplished with the right attitude.
